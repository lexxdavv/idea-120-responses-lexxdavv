# Week 5 | WMD
## Weapons of Math Destruction

After reading Weapons of Math Destruction by Cath O'Neil, it makes you realize how much we see this today. I did not know this was a thing until reading this. It's mindblowing that as stated in the reading "many poisonous assumptions are camoflaged by math this goes unquestioned and untested." Now knowing that this isn't just a situational thing it makes it a bigger deal. After hearing that teachers were getting fired for not recieving good enoughs scores on tests and in reault would be fired is very absurd. Hearing these things makes you realize how much of a big deal this is and how this is truly an day-to-day thing in society. 

Through the reading it makes in clear that WMD's are common amoungst students. With placement tests and or standardized tests. I have always thought that through taking a test it will determine your future was such a crazy thing. Personally, I know how draining this could be to someone's self-esteem. It makes your question your worthiness, if you are good enough, and will have you forever comparing yourself. With this we will always have the mindset to compete with others and always try to be better than someone else. The fact that institutions or buinesses are using scores to determine someone's future, career or measure their success is beyond me. I feel like their is a lack on consideration for those who genuinley are not good test takers. I know this first hand because as much work and time I put into studying, reviewing and and active recalling, when it comes to the test my brain literally just shuts down and I have no idea what I am doing. Which stated in the article it says the result of this is cheating. The drive to get the right answer or score to get that good grade or get into your dream school is so daunting. So, I feel as though people like me are getting a fair chance or almost set back. This is very draining for folks like me who have to go through this and spend our days comparing over numbers. 

Lastly, learning that employers are using credit scores in the hiring process is a big shocker to me. This really serves no purpose. The idea being that a poor credit score means bad work performance is mindblowing. I know people whose credit score dropped from their parents filing bankruptcy. This has nothing to do with their work ethic or them being in control of this. So, determinig someone's likelihood of landing a job based on their credit score is unfair. People go through many hard times and takes hard work to get their credit score in a good standing place to meet societal standards. 




Ultimately, I would argue that WMD are unethical, inaccurate, and not resourceful. Testing teachers, placements tests, using credit scores for hiring, and so many more do not serve a credidable purpose.
