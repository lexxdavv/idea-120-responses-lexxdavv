# Week 5 | WMD
## Weapons of Math Destruction

After reading Weapons of Math Destruction by Cath O'Neil, it makes you realize how much we see this today. I did not know this was a thing until reading this. It's mindblowing that as stated in the reading "many poisonous assumptions are camoflaged by math this goes unquestioned and untested." Now knowing that this isn't just a situational thing it makes it a bigger deal. After hearing that teachers were getting fired for not recieving good enoughs scores on tests and in reault would be fired is very absurd. Hearing these things makes you realize how much of a big deal this is and how this is truly an day-to-day thing in society. 

Through the reading it makes in clear that WMD's are common amoungst students. With placement tests and or standardized tests. I have always thought that through taking a test it will determine your future was such a crazy thing. Personally, I know how draining this could be to someone's self-esteem. It makes your question your worthiness, if you are good enough, and will have you forever comparing yourself. With this we will always have the mindset to compete with others and always try to be better than someone else. The fact that institutions or buinesses are using scores to determine someone's future, career or measure their success is beyond me. I feel like their is a lack on consideration for those who genuinley are not good test takers.











Ultimately, I would argue that WMD are unethical, inaccurate, and not resourceful. Testing teachers, placements tests, using credit scores for hiring, and so many more do not serve a credidable purpose.
