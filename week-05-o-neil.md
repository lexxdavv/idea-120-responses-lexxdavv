# Week 5 | WMD
## Weapons of Math Destruction

After reading Weapons of Math Destruction by Cath O'Neil, it makes you realize how much we see this today. I did not know this was a thing until reading this. It's mindblowing that as stated in the reading "many poisonous assumptions are camoflaged by math this goes unquestioned and untested." Now knowing that this isn't just a situational thing it makes it a bigger deal. After hearing that teachers were getting fired for not recieving good enoughs scores on tests and in reault would be fired is very absurd. Hearing these things makes you realize how much of a big deal this is and how this is truly an day-to-day thing in society. 

Through the reading it makes in clear that WMD's are common amoungst students. With placement tests and or standardized tests. 











Ultimately, I would argue that WMD are unethical, inaccurate, and not resourceful. Testing teachers, placements tests, using credit scores for hiring, and so many more do not serve a credidable purpose.
