# Gaming & Coding
 
Like many people in thw world some peole dedicate their time to gaming and coding. There are so mnay creative minds and ideas. This mkaes me wonder why are there just certain people on those teams? Why not have endless voices to bring so much more to the table? I think being able to allow more in on the creatice aspect of gaming and coding could really take things to a whole new level.

Think about it like this...why do professors or teachers or managers put us in groups? You are able to have more perspective, creativity, problem-solving skills, and endless ideas from many dfferent people. It truly gets the job done when you have many people working on that certain problem, project, job, etc. When we allow ourselves to be open to ideas, advice, and creativity we learn so much in the process. This is something that I truly love. Thinking outside of my head and jumping into how someone else's brain processes things and their creativity.

The accessibility to gaming and coding opens the doors for so much unlimited ideas for video games. Imagine your favorite game and being able to critique, edit, change and do whatever to the game to make it your best creation of what you find to be your favorite game. I think having this ability would expand the repetition of certain games and the general moral of the games. 

Just like as a kid you would make your own rules to games and such and how fun it was to be in control of the game, being able to have to access to do this in coding and gaming for video games could set it off. I think with everyine being so different and bringing something different to the table it could truly be a game changer in the video gaming world.
