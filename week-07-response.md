# Somthing is Wrong on the Internet
## James Bridle

After the reading the article by James Bridle it makes you realize and question things that are so apparent yet so unclear when we do not confront the issue. As viewers or possibly even parents, we use it or we are blind sided to these sorts of videos when we need a break from our kids. It's as simple as turning it on and the kids are glued to the videos as we do our own things. But the reading made me wuestion, how often are parents actually monitoring or knowing exactly what is being displayed to their kids? Do we realize that we are abusing children and exposing them to harm and trauma. As weird as it may be seeing adults being the one making these videos, are we aware of what they are doing just because they are dressed in kids constumes? 

Outside of Bridle's vision for what the internet should be, I think the internet should always just be a resource. I know that I may be contradicting myself because I know there are times I need a break when babysitting and turn on youtube for the kids or many of the videos stated in the reading but I think we should just be more aware of how these kinds of videos will impact children in the future, their outlook on life, and how we display things to them at a young age. Violence within kids videos should always be a red flag, especially when it is being portrayed by adults. I would say that I agree with Bridle's vision for the simple fact that we have the resposiblity on what is being put on the internet, especially when it is being displayed to children.
