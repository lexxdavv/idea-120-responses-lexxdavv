# The Gesamtkunstwerk 
#### (The Total Work of Art)

Filler Text (needs to be 2-3 paragrapghs, need a link addded)
I think the media, photography, film, different art styles and retwisting and creating new styles, technology, design programs and the evolution of avant-gardes could be used to create art that could be considered as a Gesamtkunstwerk. If we go back and define Gesamtkunstwerk, we know that it is the "total artwork." Which includes the artwork inself, the design, and all of the creative processes. These are all considered to create a work of art. 

The reason I am choosing to include [this link](https://magazine.artland.com/gesamtkunstwerk-the-total-work-of-art-through-the-ages/) is because it really goes through the "ages" of Gesamtkunstwerk. From the 1800s to modern day. This moderness has been modified in many differnt ways and styles. I personally think there is an example in the Rhizome Anthology that could qualify. Art is art. And anyone can create art. Art is simply producinng works of creativity and skill. With this concept, anything can qualify as art based on how you see it. We would have avant-gardes if art wasn't based on creativiness and perception.
