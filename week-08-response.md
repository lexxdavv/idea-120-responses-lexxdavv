I would say if not all almost 98% of the world is subject to internet tracking. You would think to yourself "how did my phone do that?" or the "how did my phone know that i was just talking about that?" It is quite strange yet so convienent (almost reminds us to pick up where we left off). I guess the main thing is truly be caareful what you search because it'll bug you for about 2 weeks. It is highly annoying but I kind of like it at time, because for the most part it is my reminder to pick up where I left off. Other times it is pretty annoying when I search one thing for someone or just out of curiosity and it continuiously shows up on all my medias. 

I don't really think the internet would be more useful with these tools for the simple fact that networkers and or marketers will find another way to get our attention. To me it is not all that bad at times. Maybe besides the simple need for privacy but we all know that our phones are more capable than we think they are. Just like many things target specific people, whether it be religion, food chains, clothing stores, etc we are all targeted in our desire. In my opinion, not just the target ads are only the problem...if there are people who love coffee and see different coffee stores or anything that reminds them of coffee then whatever gives them that attention they will consume it (not literally). I think it is a useful tool at times.
