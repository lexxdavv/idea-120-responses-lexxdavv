After reading this I was stunned. I never really realzied how out of character I get for something. For instance, it could be a movie or show, or even this or that kind of questions. It pushes you into thinking outside of what you typically wouldn't do. I find myself really relating to movie stars or even having a little obsession with actors and such and when you think about it, these actors and actresses aren't even the people we fall in love with in shows and movies. 

I use TikTok almost as my life-line at this point (not literally), I just find that it has so much information that I have never known or that I did not learn in school. We see so much that we want to be or information that we never know we needed. As a heavy TikTok user I find myself follwoing most trends. If I am understanding the question, I think that trends are reflections of the the designer;s or developer's mental structure. I think we nearly fall into what they have created or intended for us to do.
