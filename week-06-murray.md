In this file discuss if you believe Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful. 

I beleive that Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabitiing virtual enviornmetns is successful. As she stated in the reading, "As television channles and the World Wide Web come closer together, the telephone, computer, and cable industries are racing to deliver the new digital content to the end user faster and in the greater quantities." I think the relationship between the tv and the computer is endless at this day in age. As well as virtual enviornments or "worlds" I feel like it's so natural at this point. Kinda like the metaverse. You can literally be wherever you want at any time. It's the fantasy that is craved by so many. 

How does Murray's prediction compare to the hyper-realistic virtual environments the actors of 'The Mandalorian' inhabit while acting? I think it is similar to wanting to be at an advanced state of reality in the most realistc way. If that makes sense. Nearly adapting to an enviornment that has be created to seem realstic. 

Name and discuss the different layers of 'reality' both the actors and the viewers experience in the production.
