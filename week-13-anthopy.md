My first question is: why do we have violence games? 
Second: Sports games...why not just physically play them? 
Lastly: If games are an experience with rules then how come the endings are all the same? Meaning you will win or lose, die or live, or have a happily ever after.

I picked the first question because I feel like how do some find enjoyment through violence? What experince do they get from that?I recently read an article from Emile Durkheim 'The Functionalist Perspective on Crime and Deviance' and basically he had the idea that violence isinevitable d neccessary for society because it teaches us morals and right from wrong. his made me open my eyes to this statement and kind of question my own thought process on violence games.
I have never really understood the hype about games with violence or guns. My grandmother would always get mad at us for playing those kinds of games so I guess that's where I get this thought from. It's the same thought process I have about movies and shows. You know when you are just sitting and thinking? Those moments when you ask yourself "why is a door called a door?" One of those moments. I always say why does society find joy and entertainment of people faking a lifestyle...in terms of actors and atresses. I have this same ideology about why people love violence games. 
Overall, I would say that I think everyone enjoys their own things. As far as my opinion that's just what I think. I just really would love to do an interview on people who play violence games and deem them as their favorite game and why that is. No judgement or anything really just curiosity.
