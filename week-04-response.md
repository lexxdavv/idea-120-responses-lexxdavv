I have always thought that hotel pictures and resort pictures were always click-bait type of websites, ads and articles. These images based on the Roland Barthes article contains such things like luxury, relaxtion, fun, and so much more. Sometimes I even think they try to make it seem like a fantasy. This "once in a lifetime vacation filled with all-inclusive food and amenities." "All you can drink and eat." It kind of pulls you into this realm of not having to pay for anything upfront so it makes you think "what a great deal." From a resort website it says things like "...we take care of the details so you can live in the moment." These resorts and hotels give the impression of a care free lifestyle and this might be a little toxic due to the fact that this is temporary to some and not true reality.
